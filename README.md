# ModelCalibrationDeepLearning
1. Download Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images and put it in the project folder under /data
2. Execute calibration_test_split_script.py to split the test data in test and calibration data (better would be to get the calibration data from the train-data)
3. Execute the jupyter-notebooks in dir /notebooks_model_training to train the models
4. Execute the jupyter-notebooks in dir /notebooks_calibration to calibrate the models with several calibration techniques
